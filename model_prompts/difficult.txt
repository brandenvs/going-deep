Can you tell me how I might build an AI Agent using the Deepseek1.5b model?
The agent should specialise in reviewing CVs and job applications. Ensuring that the submitted CV matches a set of predefined criteria and standards that are contextually available through the RAG & vector database(pgAI).

Can you tell me how I might improve the accuracy of my local Deepseek chatbot when generating code? I want the model to be able to run, debug, and fix code.
